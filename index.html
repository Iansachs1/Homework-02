                My name is Ian Sachs and I was born and raised in San Diego, though my mom's side of the family is from texas and i lived there as well for aa time. Growing up, I always had interest in computers and design. I spent a majority of high school in film classes and started a film club at my school. I spent hours trying to recreate visual effects in final cut, premier and after effects. I stepped away from film to be close to home to help with a family member's health and fell in love with my old college job of dog training.

                After working for a few years as a protection and competition dog trainer and spending lots of time building our our facility, and managing our website, very crudely, I started having a growing interest in planning and building projects are made and wanted to know how websites and computer programs were made. That is how I found my way to this bootcamp program and had the amazing opportunity to learn with my fellow classmates and awesome instructors.
